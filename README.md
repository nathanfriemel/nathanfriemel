Hi. Iâ€™m Nathan. Most of my code is hidden in private repos.  Sometimes I do things in this [organization](https://github.com/shortminds).  I'm thinking about maype starting the process of considering re-building my [personal site](http://nathanfriemel.com/).

Most of the time I'm a enginnering manager who also codes and [Leafly](https://www.leafly.com/).
